```

Example questions:
- "How many workouts did I do this week?"
- "What's my VO2 Max trend?"
- "How has my sleep been trending this week?"

## Tips for Agents

1. **Use coach chat as the primary interface.** It has full context on the user's Apple Health workouts, heart rate, and performance — just ask natural questions.

2. **Check fatigue before recommending hard workouts.** Call `GET /api/v1/performance/pmc` and look at TSB. If TSB is below -20, the athlete is fatigued.

3. **Use the free WOD endpoint for quick workouts.** No auth needed — great for users who just want a workout suggestion.

4. **Date format is always YYYY-MM-DD** for all date parameters.
